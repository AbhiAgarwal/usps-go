The descriptions are from [here](https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/address-information.htm).

#### Address Standardization/Verification

Save time and money by reducing shipping errors due to improper address entry. This tool corrects errors in street addresses, including abbreviations and missing information. It also supplies a ZIP+4 Code.

```go
var usps USPS
usps.Username = ""
usps.Password = ""

var address Address
address.Address2 = "6406 Ivy Lane"
address.City = "Greenbelt"
address.State = "MD"

output := usps.AddressVerification(address)
```

#### Zip Code Lookup

Never get another ZIP Code wrong again with the ZIP Code Lookup tool. Find matching ZIP Codes or ZIP+4 Codes for any given address, city, and state in the U.S.

```go
var usps USPS
usps.Username = ""
usps.Password = ""

var address Address
address.Address2 = "6406 Ivy Lane"
address.City = "Greenbelt"
address.State = "MD"

output := usps.ZipCodeLookup(address)
```

#### City/State Lookup

Donâ€™t waste time searching for a city or state; use a ZIP Code to get accurate city and state information automatically.

```go
var usps USPS
usps.Username = ""

var address ZipCode
address.Zip5 = "90210"

output := usps.CityStateLookup(address)
